# Sendify Management Role Descriptions

These are suggestions from Pål, after input from the team, on how to structure Sendify’s leadership roles to prepare for scale-up. Started as an exercise for Product Development, but now expanded for the current leadership team. Note that these suggestions are not proposed as a rule book for how growing a startup _should_ be done, it’s merely a suggestion of _what to do now_, to get in a better position that is easier for the whole organization to understand in order to reduce time spent on internal issues, and make sure most energy is spent on external stakeholders.

Note that this is a heavily condensed version, since it’s far easier to later add responsibilities/tasks/areas/people that build on this base. Also, shared responsibilities such as being a good manager, good leader/role model etc are mostly not included here even though they are obviously important. There is also not a charter written for the Product Council or the Leadership Group (Alignment Group), but that is also very important to do ASAP.

## Chief Executive Officer: Fredrik Edeland

* Top level responsibility for the results of the organization as well as the recruitment and management of top managers. Reports to, and carries out the instructions of, the Board.
* Responsible for the Alignment Group and the Product Council.
* Responsible for instilling a sense of purpose that gives meaning and direction to the organization. This is distilled into the Vision and Mission.

* This role is successful if Sendify is recognized as a leader in its market and the golden standard to which competitors are compared. Sendify should also generate outsized returns to its stakeholders, compared to other similar organizations. Finally people should be proud to be affiliated with Sendify, no matter the roles they might hold.

## Head of Growth: Gustaf Hallgren

_Note: This is a MASSIVE role, and it seems likely to be too much for a single person to manage well unless this person is awesome at delegation. Also, this role has much more responsibility than some other roles described here, and as such would carry a bigger mandate. This fact might make for potentially tricky teamwork in the Management Team, depending on personal chemistry._

* Head of Growth is a combined role, being responsible for Marketing, Sales and International Expansion and in this capacity, the role is in many ways the union of all these responsibilities and is utmost responsible for increasing revenue and profits for the company as well as building a great brand. Pricing is an example of an area that is typically worked on by all these combined roles, so the word of the Head of Growth should weigh very heavily in these discussions as it really represents the thoughts of three roles.
* Head of Marketing
  * Managing all marketing activities and resources. Responsibility to both feed the Sales teams with Qualified Leads at a good pace as well as generate attention and interest for the brand, the company and the offerings using appropriate channels.
  * Scaling to lead funnel to maximize reach in each market
  * Drive self-service organic sales where possible, in order to use Sales for the cases where human touch is required. This likely includes content and product marketing initiatives.
  * Creating and executing on a comprehensive Marketing Strategy with defined budget, goals and targets to ensure creative and brand plans go well with the intended communication.
  * Budget, plan and execute advertising campaigns and make sure these have a positive ROI and appropriate pay-back time.
  * Work with the Head of Product to ensure good transition from Marketing and Sales into the Product to reduce churn and with CFO to make sure Customer Success is aligned with the promises made and that a feedback loop for learning customer pains and gains is used.
* Head of Sales
  * Recruiting, training and managing the sales team to achieve the sales targets. Work includes coaching sales people, creating scripts, helping overcome objections and deal with buyer inaction. Ensuring Sendify has an efficient and effective sales process.
  * Helping close deals, typically focusing on whales or hands-on training with new or struggling reps. Removing friction in the sales process and making sure the reps are spending their time wisely.
  * Setting, reporting and improving sales plans and budgets to make sure Sendify reaches as far as possible in sales.
  * Working together with Marketing to ensure the Leads are appropriately delivered to Sales and not better suited for self-service.
* Head of International Expansion
  * As Sendify relies on international expansion to reach the vision for the company, making sure we are executing well on this expansion is the main priority for the Head of International Expansion.
  * Research on suitable targets for expansion to deliver insights into opportunities and threats as well as reasonable expectations for roll-out plans.
  * Developing and maintaining a (_secret?_) Playbook on how to succeed within a new market with respects to Product, Sales, Marketing, Legal, Suppliers, Finance etc.
  * Recruiting, training and coaching the initial staff for a new market, with a special emphasis on the Country Manager that will be responsible for the region. Until there is a ramped up Country Manager, the Head of International Expansion will fill this role himself or find a good temporary manager.
* This role is successful if Sendify is growing revenue and profits impressively quickly compared to competitors and revenue targets are both met and exceeded.
* KPIs:
  * Primary: Total revenue, Margin, Qualified Leads, MRR, CAC, LTV, ACV, Conversion Rate (QL->Sales, Visitor->Sign Up, Signup->Sales), Customer Count
  * Secondary: Churn, NPS, EBITDA ...
* Team: Fully built out sales, marketing and management teams for expansion. Country Managers _might_ report to the CEO, but are working tight with the Head of International Expansion every week. Lots of people with tough targets to keep on track, and also a large chunk of the customer experience is managed by this person.

## Head of Finance/Chief Financial Officer: Pontus Tjernberg

* Responsible for all financial reporting, planning and budgeting at the group level. This includes accounting and taxes, payables and receivables, salaries as well as operational budgeting for each department. Making sure we know our runway and that we have good control on spending.

  * Support agreement-signers with consequence analysis of financial and legal aspects of contracts and partnerships.
* Responsible for ERP & knowledge sharing systems and all staff and suppliers needed to ensure proper operation of previous mentioned areas.

## Head of Product: Max Schagerström

* Prioritizing/sorting the list of opportunities for improvement in the product by defining expected improvements in selected metrics upon roll-out
  * Includes anything user-facing in the actual product (defined as what goes in a the Product Backlog)
  * This list includes new features, modifications/updates of existing features as well as removal or hiding of under-used/unwanted features
  * In order to do a good job at this, good market and customer research are important parts of the job as is a deep understanding of the business domain
  * There are multiple views of this list depending on the time horizon: the long-term vision, the yearly and quarterly product goals as well as the backlogs for the near-term sprints
* Scoping the most prioritized opportunities into valuable, small chunks that are possible to estimate effort for and design solutions for
  * Smaller is usually better (easier to understand for all), but overall _time_ to market/revenue/customer value is what we’re really aiming for here
  * Scoping include capabilities, expected usage/load, target customers/markets and in limiting the surface area of the opportunity/problem so that Design and Tech have a smaller target to solve for
* Overall responsibility for ensuring product is well suited for the target customers and markets
  * This role is successful if the available product offering is considered best-in-class and unsuccessful if product frustrations is a main reason for churn or low conversion rate to contract
* KPIs:
  * Primary: product-based churn, Search → 1st booking → Returning Conversion Rate, _Wallet-share?_, customer lifetime, MAU
  * Secondary: NPS/CSAT, Net Revenue Retention, Revenue, task success rate, time to complete task, user error rate, Cost per Customer/Transaction, Availability
* Team:
  * Product Owners that work very closely with one or two teams on a specific part of the product, being responsible for carrying knowledge on the opportunity and customer insights. This person acts as a proxy for HoP and is trusted to make product decisions in the ongoing sprint.

## Head of _(Product)_ Design: Oscar Lund

* Designing solutions for the most highly prioritized opportunities with varying levels of detail.
  * A simple solution may be described using rough mockups or simple flow charts, while a more complex solution may require several phases of prototyping and user testing to arrive at an acceptable solution
  * Tight collaboration between Product and Tech is key to ensure opportunities are captured and that solutions are fit for development without undue complications
* Aligning current and existing solutions in order to make the product easy to understand and use for the customer
  * As features add up, there will be dissonance between new and old parts of the product, this is akin to technical debt in that it must be managed and mortgaged off piece by piece
  * For smaller alignment jobs, this can often be included as part of another solution or handled in forced down-times/fix windows, but for larger refactorings, this will be a suggested opportunity that needs to be sorted against other opportunities, ultimately by Head of Product
* Running customer tests to measure usability, time to complete job and understand customers thought processes
  * Having good data and intuition on customer mindset is key to designing great customer experiences
* Facilitate Sendify internal communication using The Sendify Playbook and other channels
  * Internal communication is a very important part of company alignment, and design plays a key role in making sure information flows naturally from Product Development to the rest of the organization, but also has the know-how to help the rest of the company communicate more effectively
  * This is part of the reason the role is Head of Design, and not just _Product_ Design, although the word Design is so overloaded, we should make sure we don’t have a competing role planned in Growth/Marketing any time soon
* Ensuring all _(customer-facing?)_ interfaces and visuals are on-brand and beautifully designed
  * This role is successful if customers are delighted to use the product and Customer Success seldom has to explain basic usage of features, instead being able to focus on the most complex cases. The role is unsuccessful if the product is confusing or sought-after capabilities are not found and used by customers or customers ask Customer Success for help or work-arounds for “solved” features/capabilities
* KPIs:
  * Primary: task success rate, time to complete task, user error rate, Playbook usage index (edits & reads) and/or Playbook NPS
  * Secondary: NPS/CSAT, product-based churn, Apdex, Search → 1st booking → Returning Conversion Rate
* Team:
  * Designers create mockups, prototypes and high-fidelity components and styles to be used in development of solutions

## Head of Tech: Daniel Everts

* Technical implementation, delivery, maintenance and ongoing operation of the most solutions chosen for the most highly prioritized opportunities
  * Sendify has an appropriate technical architecture in place, built on sound engineering practices that enables teams to keep good velocity when shaping the product over time
  * Managing technical debt as part of ongoing work is necessary to avoid long payback cycles in the future
  * Making sure teams are clear on their boundaries for implementation choices and having speedy, pre-defined processes to make decisions on suggested changes in the stack instructions
  * Reliable operations at a reasonable price/performance point is important as the company is scaling up and usage/cost might increase faster than revenue - Keep a continuous look to make we are within acceptable bounds
* Planning of team resources and insight into operations tax to be able to keep good progress on selected opportunities
  * Knowing the available hours per person and how much of that time is addressable by Product is key to building a predictable plan without unnecessary overhead on the development teams. Keep a running tally of historical, current and future investments in operations and developer support which reduce the hours available for Product.
  * This role is successful if the product is available, performant and improved sustainably and predictably. The Tech organization is able to attract and retain top talent at a reasonable cost and also able to make use of this capability to deliver improvements at a good pace.
* Head of Data & Internal systems is included in Head of Tech
  * Data and Internal systems are key for internal stakeholders to be able to do their jobs effectively, including the Product Development organization
    * Having developers and analysts working together to both ideate on new metrics and visualizations for internal customers as well as developing and maintaining these systems is a related, but somewhat separate function of Tech.
    * Placing Data and Internal systems in Tech makes the most sense at the establishment of this new capability since there will be a lot of changes, mostly minor, needed in the tech stack to support gathering of relevant events and data to be able to do good analysis. At a later stage, this might branch out beside Tech or somewhere else altogether. Having been part of Tech at one point will likely make that future, all-important collaboration easier in many ways.
* KPIs:
  * Primary: Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate, Median Time To Restore, Change Lead Time, Cost per Customer/Transaction, Availability, Apdex, Internal Customer CSAT, Internal Data Customer CSAT
  * Secondary: NPS/CSAT, product-based churn, user error rate
* Team:
  * Team Leaders manage and coach development teams with backend and frontend developers to implement the selected solutions.
  * Teams work closely with Product Owners and Designers to ensure valuable delivery in the expected time frame
  * Teams handle ongoing operations and maintenance of their respective artifacts/systems as part of ongoing responsibilities
  * Data/Internal team supports
